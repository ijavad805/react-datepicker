# Playground

Experiment with the React Datepicker component directly in your browser. Use the
controls below to toggle themes, switch between English and Persian locales, or
flip the widget into dark mode without leaving the documentation.

<BrowserOnly fallback={<div className="alert alert--secondary">Loading the playground…</div>}>
  {() => <DatepickerPlayground />}
</BrowserOnly>

## What to try next

- Explore the [Datepicker guide](./datepicker.md) for a complete list of props
  and customization options.
- Review the [Calendar guide](./calendar.md) to coordinate picker and calendar
  behaviors across your application.
- File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ijavad805/react-datepicker/issues)
  if you run into a bug or have feedback about the playground experience.
